PHILOSOPHICAL ATTRIBUTION:

This software is based on the linguistic theories of Bhartṛhari (c. 5th century),
a Sanskrit grammarian and philosopher who developed the concept of "Sphoṭa" 
(the holistic, indivisible unit of meaning).

Key concepts implemented:
- Akhaṇḍapakṣa (Sentence Holism)
- Vākyasphoṭa (Sentence Meaning)
- The 12 linguistic determinants for meaning resolution

While Bhartṛhari's works are in the public domain, this implementation and 
commentary are subject to the MIT License above.
