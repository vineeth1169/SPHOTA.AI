# Sphota Voice AI - MVP Requirements
# Philosophy: Bhartṛhari's Sentence Holism (Akhaṇḍapakṣa)
#
# Sphota: A Cognitive Meaning Engine
# An Intent-First NLU based on Bhartṛhari's Linguistic Monism.
#
# Unlike traditional LLMs that predict the next token, Sphota identifies 
# the Vākyasphoṭa (holistic sentence meaning) prior to syntactic processing.
# It utilizes a Context Resolution Matrix to resolve polysemy via spatial 
# and temporal metadata (Deśa/Kāla).
#
# Features:
# - Apabhraṃśa Normalization: Maps slang/accented inputs to pure intent vectors.
# - Context-Aware: Resolves ambiguity using 12 dynamic context factors.
# - Privacy-First: runs entirely locally using SBERT and ChromaDB.
